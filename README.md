Introduction
We must understand the basics of Python before we can use it to analyze financial data. Chapter 2 of Wes McKinney's Python for Data Analysis provides a crash 
course in Python's syntax, and chapter 3 provides a crash course in Python's built-in data structures. This notebook focuses on the "Python Language Basics" in 
section 2.3, which covers language semantics, scalar types, and control flow.

*Note:* Indented block quotes are from McKinney unless otherwise indicated. The section numbers here differ from McKinney because we will only discuss some 
topics.
