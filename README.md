Introduction
We must understand the basics of Python before we can use it to analyze financial data. Chapter 2 of Wes McKinney's Python for Data Analysis provides a crash 
course in Python's syntax, and chapter 3 provides a crash course in Python's built-in data structures. This notebook focuses on the "Python Language Basics" in 
section 2.3, which covers language semantics, scalar types, and control flow.

*Note:* Indented block quotes are from McKinney unless otherwise indicated. The section numbers here differ from McKinney because we will only discuss some 
topics.


We will focus on the following:

1. Data structures
    1. tuples
    1. lists
    1. dicts (also known as dictionaries)
    1. *we will ignore sets*
1. List comprehensions
1. Functions
    1. Returning multiple values
    1. Using anonymous functions

We will focus on:

1. Creating arrays
1. Slicing arrays
1. Applying functions and methods to arrays
1. Using conditional logic with arrays (i.e., `np.where()` and `np.select()`)
